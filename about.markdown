I am the Director of Biostatistics and Data Science and an Associate Professor at the [Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE)][AH] at Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC. Prior to coming to CORE, I worked for ~ 25 years in academia and industry. Notably, I was an Associate Professor of Statistics at Colorado State University. Prior to that, I was an Assistant Professor of Statistics at West Virginia University. As a statistical consultant, I've partnered with multidisciplinary faculty on numerous extramurally funded studies that span data science, computational statistics and translational and outcomes research. I've worked extensively in the private sector including supporting the development of medical therapies and devices from research to market launch. I've authored or co-authored almost 50 peer-reviewed articles.

My primary areas of expertise are experimental design, general and advanced methodological techniques, modeling and forecasting, sampling and sample design, statistical computing, and teaching.

I"0<p>Nowadays, because of high market demand and because of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), many people are calling themselves a “data scientist”. But what does this job title actually mean? Many articles on the internet do a great job giving a comprehensive checklist of computational skills necessary to be a data scientist, but to me this view is too narrow. My approach in this short article is to give a brief overview of three general areas that I feel constitute a complete data scientist. They are not listed in any preferential order.</p>
